# Rails Final Project

By now, you know how to build sophisticated full web applications in Rails. Next, you're going to build your own Rails app from scratch.

## Setup

Download the `flatiron-rails` gem:

`gem install flatiron-rails`

Then when you start you app, instead of running `rails new MyApp`, run `flatiron-rails new MyApp`. The gem builds a rails app just like the `rails new` command, but adds a few useful things like RSpec as the testing framework and an executable to deploy to Heroku.

## Objectives

This project can be anything you want! Like always, try to build something that you would use, or something that uses a technology you're excited to learn more about. The only rule is you can't use JavaScript. You should be focusing on working with Rails, not making a full-stack web application yet. Feel free to use Bootstrap for styling though.

## Ideas

* Build an API with best practices (namespacing, versioning, complex jbuilder rendering, etc) and maybe for your next iteration, you can serve as JSON to a JavaScript app
* Work with external API(s) to build something interesting. Get good at making efficient API calls with either a wrapper gem for that API or the Typhoeus gem and well thought out Object Oriented code
* Build a complex domain model with nested forms

## Timeframe

This project should take the weekend to complete. 

## Deployment

Deploy your app when you're done! If it uses a database, be sure to convert it to Postgres from MySQL for Heroku.

## Bonus

Spec it out!
